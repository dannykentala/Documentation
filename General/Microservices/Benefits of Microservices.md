### Agility

**Microservices foster an organization of small, independent teams that take ownership of their services.** Teams act within a small and well understood context, and are empowered to work more independently and more quickly. This shortens development cycle times. You benefit significantly from the aggregate throughput of the organization.

### Easy Deployment

Microservices enable continuous integration and continuous delivery, making it easy to try out new ideas and to roll back if something doesnâ€™t work. The low cost of failure enables experimentation, makes it easier to update code, and accelerates time-to-market for new features.

### Scalability 

Microservices architecture also lets you scale each service independently. You can deploy the number of instances of each service that satisfy its capacity and availability constraints. You can also use the hardware that best matches a service's resource requirements. When you scale services independently, you help increase the availability and the reliability of the entire system.

### Code Reutilization

Extracting cross-cutting business applications or cross-cutting services so that you can reuse them across multiple channels. Examples of services you might want to reuse include payment services, login services, encryption services, flight search services, customer profile services, and notification services.
