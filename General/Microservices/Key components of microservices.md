### Service Communication:
Microservices communicate via APIs, with RESTful APIs and message queues being common choices.  

### Containerization:
Docker containers package microservices and their dependencies for consistency across environments.  

### Service Discovery:
Tools like Consul or Eureka help microservices dynamically locate and communicate with each other.  

### API Gateway:
An API Gateway centralizes entry points, handling tasks like authentication, authorization, and load balancing.  

**See:** 

### Database per Microservice:
Each microservice has its database, ensuring data autonomy and flexibility.  

## Event Sourcing and CQRS:
Implementing these patterns provides flexibility in managing and querying data.  

### Logging and Monitoring:
Tools like ELK Stack help track the health and performance of microservices.  

### Security:
Authentication, authorization, and encryption (SSL/TLS) are crucial for securing microservices.
